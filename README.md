## Description

This repo hosts the datasets (PDDL files) for various conference papers that I have published. Currently, I have data from:

- [Efficient Symbolic Approaches for Quantitative Reactive Synthesis with Finite Tasks (IROS 23)](https://muvvalakaran.github.io/publication/iros23_symbolic/)
- [Let's Collaborate: Regret-based Reactive Synthesis for Robotic Manipulation (ICRA 22)](https://muvvalakaran.github.io/publication/icra_22_regret/)
